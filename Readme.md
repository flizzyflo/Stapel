## Own Stack Class

This is my own stack datastructure. It consists of two classes - the stack itself and the stack element class.
The stack class manages the stack and stores the stack elements. this class covers all the actions which need to be performed on a stack.
The stack element class is some kind of data class, which holds the values and a pointer to the next stack element. Furthermore, it contains two get methods to provide values to the stack class.
